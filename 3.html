    <h2>서진누나</h2>

    <p><u>HyunJu</u> is my <strong>girlfriend.</strong> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html 5.2">She changed my life.</a> I learned how to love,
    how to considerate others, how to forgive, how to say sorry...from her.
    now, she is important part of my life. I love her.<br>
    She always says "I'm very Hungry, I can eat anything!" but she couldn't eat much.
    She always "I hate sleep! I can't sleep anymore!" but she slept soon.
    This look of her is very very cute and lovely.</p>

    <p>They met in "밤식탁" which is bar is being operated by their frined, HyunJu.
    Jun U is an actor. He apppeared some films and soap opera. and SeoJin is working in LH.
    When they hang out with other friend, it is really fun. but they fight everyday. The reason of fight is really small things.
    just a words, message etc...
    and after fighting, they contact to HyunJu. HyunJu enjoys judge their fight. I think she is pervert.</p>
